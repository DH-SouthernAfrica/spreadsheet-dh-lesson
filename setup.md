> ## Data

> **Download** this data file to your computer: [Messy data](../data/digital_humanities/ASummerofdigitalhumanitiesATwitterArchive_messy.xlsx) 

> #### About the data
> The data for this lesson is a part of a draft Data Carpentry Digital Humanities workshop. 

> Twitter data spanning a period of three and a half months was downloaded. Each Tweet containing the hashtag #digitalhumanities during > the period 1 June 2014 - 15 September 2014 was captured in a spreadsheet. The original dataset is available from [Figshare](https://figshare.com/articles/A_Summer_of_digitalhumanities_A_Twitter_Archive/1176099) and was created by [Ernesto Priego](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4418-369X) through the use of software that downloaded the Tweets through the Twitter API. The spreadsheet > contains information about the handle of the Tweeter, the Tweet text, time and date of Tweet, language, platform from which the Tweet > was sent, and more. Because the original dataset was generated by software, it is already in a relatively clean, machine readible format.
>
> To illustrate some of the common formatting and other mistakes that can be made when researchers are collecting data in spreadsheets, > we have created a messy version of the original dataset. Our story is that we had 2 student assistants who collected the data at separate times and in slightly different formats in their spreadsheets.  
> 
> The data in this lesson is a subset of the original version that has been intentionally 'messed up' for this lesson. 
>  
> The data for this lesson and the workshop are available at [A Summer of #digitalhumanities](https://figshare.com/articles/A_Summer_of_digitalhumanities_A_Twitter_Archive/1176099/1) and is published with a CC-BY license and is available for reuse.

To interact with spreadsheets, we can use LibreOffice, Microsoft Excel, Gnumeric, OpenOffice.org, or other programs. Commands may differ a bit between programs, but general ideas for thinking about spreadsheets are the same.

For this lesson, if you don't have a spreadsheet program already, you can use LibreOffice. It's a free, open source spreadsheet program.
